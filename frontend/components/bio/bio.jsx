            <span>Hi there! My name is Gabe and I'm a software developer, growth marketer and music lover. I have built web applications with Javascript, React, and Ruby on Rails and I love testing my critical-thinking and creative problem-solving through writing code.

I also have a background in digital marketing and managed advertising efforts at Industrious, a national coworking space provider and Ampush, an ad agency in San Francisco. Outside of work, I love going to concerts, making beats, and travelling to new places. Let's build something incredible together!</span>
